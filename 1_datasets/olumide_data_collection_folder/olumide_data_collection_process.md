# Milestone 2

**Research Question:**
How do wage trajectories of recent immigrant software engineers differ from
native-born peers with similar age and experience, and how do interconnected
factors—such as recognition of foreign credentials, company hiring
practices, language barriers, and access to networks—shape these outcomes
within the U.S. tech labor system during their first five years?

## Data Collection goals

- Find data that shows me current trend in wage gap among native and immigrants
in the tech space (software engineering)
- If there's a change in trend or trajectory can i trace and understand the
cause (event/events that occurred during the timeline)
- Is there a trend in age? affecting pay
- Any relevant immigration policy change/event
- How's AI impacting the way tech employees are hired
- National trend compare to more specific local trend e.g usa vs sf

## Constraints

- Difficult to find exact and specific updated info

## Defining my Variables

- **Independent Variables:** i.e Salary
- **Dependent Variables:** i.e Education
