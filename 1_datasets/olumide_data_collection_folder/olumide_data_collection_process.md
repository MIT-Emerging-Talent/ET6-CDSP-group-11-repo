# Milestone 2

**Research Question:**
How do wage trajectories of recent immigrant software engineers differ from
native-born peers with similar age and experience, and how do interconnected
factors—such as recognition of foreign credentials, company hiring
practices, language barriers, and access to networks—shape these outcomes
within the U.S. tech labor system during their first five years?

## Data Collection goals

- Find data that shows me current trend in wage gap among native and immigrants
in the tech space (software engineering)
- If there's a change in trend or trajectory can i trace and understand the
cause (event/events that occured during the timeline)
- Is there a trend in age? affecting pay
- Any relevant immigration policy change/event
- How's AI impacting the way tech employees are hired
- National trend compare to more specific local trend e.g usa vs sf

## Constraints

- Difficult to find exact and specific updated info

## Defining my Variables

- **Independent Variables:** i.e Salary
- **Dependent Variables:** i.e Education

## Interesting datasets and initial reactions

### Key takeaways

Median Wage Movement (2008 – 2015)

- **Great Recession dip:** Median offers for immigrant software engineers fell
from **≈ $96 k (2008)** to **≈ $74 k (2010)**.  
- **Tech-sector rebound:** Pay climbed back to the **high-$80 k / low-$90 k**
range by 2012-2014, then softened slightly in 2015.  
- **Take-away:** Macro shocks hit newcomers hard, but tech wages recovered
faster than the wider labor market.

### Credential Effects

| Required Degree | Median Offer* |
|-----------------|---------------|
| PhD             | **≈ $127 k**  |
| Bachelor’s      | **≈ $105–110 k** |
| Master’s        | Slightly below bachelor’s |

\*Based on roles where the petition explicitly listed the minimum degree.

- **Interpretation:** PhDs command the biggest premium; bachelor’s-level
petitions often out-earn “master’s preferred” roles because many mid-level
SWE jobs accept either credential.

### Big Tech company effect

- **FAANG / Top-tier** ( e.g Google, Microsoft, Twitter) **≈ $120–130 k**
- **Large enterprise / consulting** (e.g outsourcing firms) **≈ $90–100 k**

- **Implication:** Landing a job at a top-tier firm can substitute for several
years of ordinary raises elsewhere.

### Caveat

The file covers **only foreign-born petitions**. To estimate a true
immigrant-vs-native wage gap we still need a matched sample of native-born
software engineers.
