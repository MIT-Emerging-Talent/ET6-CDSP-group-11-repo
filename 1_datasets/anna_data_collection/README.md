# Census Data Research - Visible Minorities, Education, Income, and Employment

## Overview

As part of our research project, I explored publicly available Canadian Census
data from the official Statistics Canada website:  
[https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/dp-pd/dt-td/Index-eng.cfm?LANG=E&QTEXT=98-10&SR=0&RPP=50&SUB=98P1009&GK=&sort=releasedate&DETAIL=1](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/dp-pd/dt-td/Index-eng.cfm?LANG=E&QTEXT=98-10&SR=0&RPP=50&SUB=98P1009&GK=&sort=releasedate&DETAIL=1)

The goal was to locate datasets aligned with our core research question
concerning the relationships between ethnicity, education, income,
immigration status, and employment sectors in Canada.

## Data Selection and Cleaning

After reviewing several candidate tables, I identified a few
that were particularly relevant to our focus. From these,
I extracted and cleaned three separate datasets:

1. **Immigrants Visible Minorities Dataset**  
   - Contains data on visible minority populations in Canada **country of origin**.
   - Includes variables related to **education level** and **income brackets**.
   - **Income is presented as a mean value** for each demographic group.

2. **Non-Immigrants Dataset**  
   - Focuses on non-immigrant populations, but also includes visible minority info.
   - Includes similar variables: **education levels** and **income ranges**,
   enabling comparison with the visible minority dataset.
   - **Income is presented as a mean value** for each demographic group.

3. **Combined Immigrant/Non-Immigrant Dataset**  
   - Includes both immigrants and non-immigrants.
   - Focuses on **education levels** and the **industrial sectors**
   in which they are employed.
   - **Income is presented as a mean and average value** for each group.

## Next Steps

These cleaned datasets form the basis for our upcoming data analysis
and visualization efforts. They will help answer questions about systemic
inequality, economic mobility, and the relationship between education and
employment outcomes across different groups in Canada.
