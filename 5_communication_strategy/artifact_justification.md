# Communication Artifact Justification

## Chosen Medium: Quick Start Action Guide

### Why This Format Works Best for Our Audience

#### Tech Leaders Need Practical Tools, Not Just Information

Our primary audience consists of engineering managers, CTOs, and HR
professionals who are:

- Time-constrained and results-oriented
- Comfortable with data but need actionable next steps  
- Responsible for making immediate decisions with budget implications
- Looking for concrete ways to address equity issues

### Design Principles Applied

#### 1. Scannable Format

- Checkbox lists for easy progress tracking
- Clear time investments for each action
- Visual indicators for quick comprehension

#### 2. Immediate Value

- 30-day timeline creates urgency without overwhelming
- Week-by-week breakdown makes large problem manageable
- "Red flags" section addresses common urgent issues

#### 3. Addresses Resistance

- "Common Excuses" section anticipates push back
- Business case leads with financial impact
- Success metrics provide measurable outcomes

#### 4. Builds Confidence

- Starts with easy 2-hour assessment
- Progresses logically from analysis to action
- Provides fallback options ("Need Help?" section)

### How This Translates Our Research

#### Statistical Findings → Business Language

- "Statistically significant disparities" becomes "Your company likely
has wage gaps"
- "p < 0.05" becomes "95% of cases studied"  
- Complex intersectional analysis becomes "Red flags to address immediately"

#### Academic Uncertainty → Practical Risk Management

- Instead of discussing confidence intervals, we emphasize starting with
available data
- Rather than explaining statistical limitations, we provide "success metrics"
for ongoing monitoring
- We acknowledge imperfection while emphasizing action: "You don't need perfect
data to start"

### Research Methodology → Implementation Process

- Our systematic data analysis approach becomes their systematic assessment
process
- Our sensitivity testing becomes their monitoring and adjustment framework
- Our peer-reviewed approach becomes their committee-based decision making

This communication artifact transforms our complex statistical analysis
