# Communication Strategy: Interactive Data Visualization for Wage Equity Research

## Target Audience Research & Validation

We need to validate our communication approach through targeted research.

### Primary Audience: Academic Researchers

- **Current Challenge:** Limited connection to industry wage practices
- **Research Need:** Interviews with labor economics researchers
- **Validation Plan:** MIT faculty consultations in relevant fields

### Secondary Audiences

1. D&I Team Members
2. HR Personnel
3. Engineering Hiring Managers

#### Validation Approach

- Conduct focused interviews with audience representatives
- Test data visualization preferences
- Validate analytical tool interaction patterns

## Proposed Solution: Interactive Visualization

### Research Questions to Validate

1. For Academic Researchers:
   - How do they currently consume wage equity research?
   - What visualization tools do they commonly use?
   - What barriers exist in translating research to practice?

2. For Industry Practitioners:
   - What data formats drive decision-making?
   - How much time do they spend analyzing research?
   - What evidence convinces them to take action?

### Proposed Solution Features

**Beyond Traditional Publication:** Academic papers reach researchers;
Tableau dashboards reach decision-makers.

**Scalable Implementation:**

- Framework can be applied to any company's internal compensation data
- Creates ongoing monitoring capability, not just point-in-time insights
- Enables industry-wide adoption of equity practices

### 3. Addresses Communication Challenges Unique to Our Findings

**Complex Intersectional Data:** Our research shows gender×race×education
interactions

- **Static charts:** Can only show 2-3 variables at once
- **Tableau filters:** Users can explore all combinations dynamically

**Uncertainty Communication:** We found some limitations in our
cross-sectional data

- **Academic approach:** Discuss confidence intervals and methodology
limitations
- **Tableau approach:** Visual uncertainty indicators that executives
understand

**Actionable Translation:** Statistical findings need to become business decisions

- **Research output:** "Gender wage gap significant at p < 0.05"
- **Dashboard output:** "Cost of inaction: $2.3M average lawsuit settlement"

### 4. Competitive Advantage in Science Communication

**Industry Standard Tool:** Tech executives expect Tableau-level sophistication

- Using PowerPoint would signal amateur analysis
- Using academic visualization tools would create adoption barriers
- Tableau demonstrates we understand business communication norms

**Self-Service Analytics:** Empowers executives to be their own analysts

- Reduces dependence on our team for follow-up questions
- Builds confidence through independent exploration
- Creates "stickiness" - they keep using it after initial presentation

## Specific Benefits for Our Dataset

### Handles Our Research Complexity

- **Multiple demographic variables** → Interactive filtering system
- **Statistical significance testing** → Visual confidence indicators
- **Outlier analysis** → Toggle views with/without extreme values
- **Sensitivity testing** → Scenario modeling capabilities

### Addresses Our Audience Needs

- **Time-pressed executives** → 5-second insight rule with drill-down options
- **Data-comfortable but not statistical** → Business metrics, not academic
measures
- **Budget authority** → ROI calculators and cost-benefit scenarios
- **Implementation responsibility** → Action-oriented dashboard views

### Maximizes Our Research ROI

- **One-time development** → Ongoing impact through multiple users
- **Scalable framework** → Applicable to other companies and datasets
- **Professional credibility** → Positions team as serious business consultants
- **Industry influence** → Creates tool that spreads equity practices

## Research and Validation Plan

### Phase 1: Understanding Our Audience (Week 1-2)

- Conduct structured interviews with target audiences
- Document current research consumption patterns
- Identify key barriers to research adoption
- Map decision-making processes

### Phase 2: Testing Communication Approaches (Week 3-4)

- Create prototype visualizations in different formats
- Test various levels of interactivity
- Measure comprehension and retention
- Gather feedback on actionability

### Phase 3: Solution Development (Week 5-6)

- Select tools based on research findings
- Develop initial visualizations
- Create accompanying documentation
- Plan distribution strategy

### Phase 4: Validation and Refinement (Week 7-8)

- Conduct usability testing
- Measure impact metrics
- Refine based on feedback
- Document lessons learned

## Next Steps

1. Schedule interviews with MIT faculty
2. Create interview protocol
3. Develop prototype visualizations
4. Plan validation metrics
