### Discussion on Refining the Question  

The group discussed ways to refine and focus the chosen question to meet the
Monday deadline.  

- Ideas were exchanged by Oleksandr, Anna, and Dorcas about restructuring,
scope, and framing.  
- Despite the lively discussion, the group did not land on a final refined
version of the question.

### Next Steps and Suggestions  

Olumide encouraged a deeper individual dive into the selected
research question.
Each member is expected to:

- Brainstorm independently
- Summarize their understanding of the topic  
- Identify actionable components and possible data sources

Oleksandr shared a **template** form a previous emerging talent group shared
by evan to help structure the research question and
understanding:

The group acknowledged the current **limited domain knowledge** and agreed
to spend more time studying and researching the topic before data
collection begins next week.

### Role Distribution Suggestion  

Kervens suggested dividing responsibilities by task or strength area.  

- The group supported this idea and will explore implementing it soon.  
- This approach would ensure all members contribute meaningfully and in ways
aligned with their skills and interests.

## Summary  

The meeting was productive in aligning the team’s focus around a top-voted
research question and identifying the need for deeper understanding before
refining and executing the project. Next steps include individual research,
using shared templates, and continuing team collaboration toward a clearer
scope and division of responsibilities.
