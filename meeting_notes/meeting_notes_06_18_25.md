## Key Updates

- Anna informed the group that Heba was not approved by Evan to join our team.
- We will move forward with the current group members only.

## Research Discussion

We discussed how to refine our research question and determine a suitable
domain. Three directions were proposed:

1. Compare industries (e.g., Medicine vs. Tech)
2. Compare countries or regions
3. Focus deeply on a specific sphere to meet project constraints

We are currently undecided on which path to take.

## Evan’s Feedback (via Slack)

“Wow! These are three interesting questions. Because they’re closely related,
how about this: Don’t decide yet.  
They all require similar data, so you can look broadly for data that’s relevant
to any or all of the questions and decide which question to focus on based on
the data you find—or based on which one you all find more interesting after
sitting on it for a week.”

- Feel free to respond to the thread with any concerns and insight.

## Group Next Steps

- We consulted Evan about further for clarification or guidance if needed.
- Waiting for contributions from group members (Louis and Oleksandr) for  
convergent thinking (Not mandatory, but encouraged.)
- We may proceed with what we already have if no further input is received.
- We will look to meet again this **Weekend** to continue discussions
and finalize direction.
