# 💻 Software Engineer Earnings Analysis

We are **Confidence crew**, a collaborative team from the MIT Emerging Talent Program.
Our project explores **wage disparities in the U.S. tech industry**, asking:  
👉 *How do education, gender, race, and age affect software engineer earnings?*

Our work combines **data cleaning, statistical analysis, and clear communication**
to translate raw data into actionable insights
for both technical and non-technical audiences.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Software engineering is one of the fastest-growing and best-paid careers.  
But behind the averages, our analysis shows **systemic disparities**:

- Gender wage gaps persist across all education levels  
- Education boosts pay, but returns plateau at higher levels  
- Racial disparities exist, though size and direction vary  
- Career progression patterns differ significantly by demographic  

We approached the problem step by step: defining the domain,
collecting and preparing data, running statistical analysis,
and finally building communication tools to share our findings.

## 🔍 Research Structure

Our central question:  
**Which demographic factors significantly influence software engineer earnings,
and how can results be communicated effectively to decision makers?**

We broke this into sub-steps:  

1. **Domain Study** → wage equity in tech and prior research  
2. **Data Preparation** → cleaning & structuring U.S. engineer earnings data  
3. **Exploratory Analysis** → patterns across education, gender, and race  
4. **Statistical Testing** → t-tests, ANOVA, regression modeling  
5. **Communication** → dashboards, summaries, and strategy for industry

## 📋 Project Milestones

Following the Collaborative Data Science Project (CDSP) structure:  

- **Milestone 0:** Team setup, tooling, and collaboration norms  
- **Milestone 1:** Problem Identification → [Domain Study](./0_domain_study)  
- **Milestone 2:** Data Collection & Cleaning → [Datasets](./1_datasets)  
- **Milestone 3:** Analysis → [Findings](./4_data_analysis)  
- **Milestone 4:** Communication → [Strategy](./5_communication_strategy)  
- **Milestone 5:** Final Presentation → [Slides & Summary](./6_final_presentation)

## 📌 Main Finding

While **education is a strong predictor of earnings**, systemic disparities remain:

- Women earn less than men with the same education (p < 0.05)  
- Racial wage gaps vary but are statistically significant  
- Advanced degrees increase earnings but with diminishing returns  

---

## ✅ Conclusion

Our analysis shows that **structural inequities persist in the U.S. tech workforce**,
even among software engineers.  

By pairing rigorous analysis with **interactive dashboards and executive summaries**,
we aim to make the findings useful for decision makers.  
The key takeaway: addressing pay equity is not only a matter of fairness — it is
also a **business advantage** in recruiting, retention, and competitiveness.

## 📣 Communication Strategy

We focused on translating our findings for **tech leaders and HR professionals**
who:  

- Are aware of wage gaps but lack specific evidence  
- Need quick, visual, and actionable insights  

### Core Messages  

1. The data is clear – wage gaps are real and significant.  
2. Practical solutions exist – pay audits and structured frameworks.  
3. Fair pay is a business advantage – equity boosts retention and reputation.  

### Mediums  

- **Tableau Dashboard** → explore wage gaps by gender × race × education  
- **Executive Summary (1 page)** → quick business case  
- **Quick Start Guide (30 days)** → step-by-step HR action plan
