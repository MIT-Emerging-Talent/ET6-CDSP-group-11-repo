# Milestone X Retrospective

> _Reflecting on our teamwork, process, and deliverables for Milestone X_

---

## 1. Attendance & Participation

- **Workshop** on [date]: Were ≥ 2 members present?  
- **Team meetings** held vs. planned  
- **Async engagement**: Slack threads, GitHub comments, pull-request reviews  

---

## 2. Stop Doing

- Waiting until the last minute to create issues on the project board  
- Skipping thorough reviews of draft deliverables (code, documents, slides)  
- Failing to take or share clear meeting notes within 12 hrs  
- Letting stale branches linger after merges  

---

## 3. Continue Doing

- Sharing responsibilities evenly across tasks and milestones  
- Respectful, inclusive communication in workshops, Zoom syncs, and Slack  
- Enforcing branch protections, PR templates, and milestone tracking  
- Delivering well-documented artifacts (README updates, scripts, surveys) on time

---

## 4. Start Doing

- Proactively opening GitHub issues for each deliverable subtask  
- Assigning a second reviewer to merge pull requests after approval  
- Deleting obsolete branches immediately post-merge  
- Scheduling “office hours” for mentor or domain-expert Q&A  
- Automating basic checks (dataset validation scripts, README link tests) in CI

---

## 5. Lessons Learned

- Early breakdown of tasks on the board reduces last-minute rush  
- Thorough reviews catch gaps before they become blockers  
- Clear agendas and timely notes keep everyone aligned  
- Balancing synchronous workshops and async work maximizes group productivity

## 6. Strategy vs. Board

| Question                                           | Reflection                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Which planned tasks went as expected?**          | e.g., “Repo setup & group norms completed by deadline.”         |
| **Which tasks did not work out?**                  | e.g., “Data-model discussion exceeded time and required follow-up.” |
| **Did we add unplanned steps?**                    | e.g., “Added CI check for dataset schema validation.”           |
| **Did we remove planned steps?**                   | e.g., “Skipped persona mapping due to time constraints.”        |
