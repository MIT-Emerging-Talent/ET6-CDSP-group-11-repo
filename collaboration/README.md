- Address misunderstandings or errors directly and collaboratively.  
- Build credibility through consistent follow-through and transparency.

### Affective Trust

- Respect each member’s ideas, backgrounds, and contributions.  
- Resolve conflicts with empathy, listening to all perspectives.  
- Show appreciation and encouragement for each other’s efforts.  
- Prioritize group well-being and maintain a non-judgmental atmosphere.

- Clearly label and organize discussions by topic or task.  
- Respond to messages within agreed-upon timeframes.

## Discussion & Decision-Making

### Discussion

- Focus on exploring diverse viewpoints to foster understanding.  
- Encourage sharing personal experiences or examples.  
- Aim for inclusivity, ensuring quieter voices are heard.  
- Recognize that some discussions may remain unresolved.

### Decision-Making

- Clearly state objectives and criteria before starting a debate.  
- Use structured approaches (e.g., pros/cons lists, voting) for key decisions.  
- Debate ideas, not individuals; remain respectful at all times.  
- Seek consensus when possible; be prepared to move forward with majority support.
- Document decisions and rationale for future reference.

## Time Management & Adaptability

### Scheduling

- Set deadlines and milestones collaboratively to ensure alignment.  
- Use shared calendars to coordinate availability and timelines.  
- Adjust plans as needed based on evolving project needs or challenges.  
- Maintain flexibility to accommodate unforeseen changes.  
- Balance task focus with the ability to pivot when necessary.

### Punctuality

- Notify the team promptly if delays or absences occur.  
- Value both structured schedules and the need for adaptability.

 time zones.
