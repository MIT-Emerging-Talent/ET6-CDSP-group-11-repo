# Constraints

Some boundaries around our Collaborative Data Science Project.

## External

<!-- Constraints imposed by syllabus or external stakeholders -->

- **Milestone Deadlines**  
  - Milestone 0 (Cross-Cultural Collaboration): June 2, 2025  
  - Milestone 1 (Problem Identification): June 16, 2025  
  - Milestone 2 (Data Collection): June 30, 2025  
  - Milestone 3 (Data Analysis): July 21, 2025  
  - Milestone 4 (Communicating Results): August 11, 2025  
  - Milestone 5 (Final Presentation): August 25, 2025  
  - Final Presentation Event: TBD

- **Workshop Attendance**  
  - Weekly workshops run May 27 – end of August.  
  - At least **2** members per group must attend each milestone workshop.  
  - Notify Emerging Talent team ahead of absences.

- **Required Tools & Platforms**  
  - **GitHub** for repo, issues, pull requests, milestone tracking.  
  - **Slack** (or equivalent) for team communication.  
  - **Google Calendar** (or equivalent) for scheduling.  
  - Public hosting (GitHub Pages, Google Drive, etc.) for datasets and deliverables.

- **Submission Process**  
  - A form linking to your repo and short survey must be submitted at the end
  of each milestone.  
  - All deliverables must be organized in the repo with clear README paths.

- **Participation Load**  
  - Minimum **8 hours/week** per member:  
    - 1.5 hrs workshop attendance  
    - 1.5 hrs team meeting  
    - 5 + hrs asynchronous work  

## Internal: Involuntary

<!-- Constraints that arise from team makeup or external obligations -->

- **Skill & Experience Variance**  
  - Team members have diverse backgrounds in data science, coding,
  and Git workflow.  
  - Pairing offered to best match guys in a best fit manner.

- **Time Zones & Availability**  
  - Group spans multiple time zones—meeting times must accommodate at least
   **three** members.  
  - Members with limited windows must be given asynchronous updates and
  written meeting minutes.

- **Connectivity & Resources**  
  - Reliable internet required for meetings and code reviews.  
  - Members with intermittent access will coordinate via Slack threads
  and recorded notes.

- **External Obligations**  
  - Work, school, or family commitments may reduce availability.  
  - Advance notice is required for planned absences; tasks will be redistributed.

## Internal: Voluntary

<!-- Constraints the team agrees on to keep the project running smoothly -->

- **Coding Standards & Repo Hygiene**  
  - Follow a shared style guide (PEP-8 for Python, conventional commits, etc.).
  - Enforce branch protections, pull-request templates, and automated linting.

- **Communication Norms**  
  - Use the agreed “## Communication Schedule” cadence:  
    - Mon: Workshop recap + role assignments  
    - Tue/Thu: Slack async updates  
    - Wed: Mid-week Zoom sync  
    - Fri: Weekly summary email + GitHub issue  
    - Sat: Self-study log & pushes  
    - Sun: Agenda planning + confirmations  
  - All agendas posted **24 hrs** before meetings; minutes shared within
  **12 hrs** after.

- **Task & Time Commitment**  
  - Define and assign issues in GitHub with clear due dates.  
  - Estimate **4–5 hrs** per week per member; track time in a shared
  spreadsheet or tool.

- **Retrospectives & Continuous Improvement**  
  - Conduct a brief retrospective at each milestone submission.  
  - Capture “What went well” and “What to improve” in a `/retrospectives` folder.

- **Study Plan Sharing**  
  - Each member maintains a personal study plan linked from the repo README.  
  - Technical mentors may review and suggest resources as needed.

- **Conflict Resolution**  
  - First, attempt resolution in group discussion.  
  - If unresolved, escalate to majority vote or project guide consultation.
