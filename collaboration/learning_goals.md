# Learning Goals

## Collective

- Build confidence in how we tackle coding challenges together.
- Explore fresh ideas and tricks that make our work more fun and creative.
- Write solutions that are clear, easy to follow, and a pleasure to share.
- Give and get helpful feedback—so every review feels like a chance to learn.
- Create a space where everyone feels comfortable pitching ideas and asking questions.
- Grow our problem-solving muscles by practicing regularly as a team.

## Individual

## Olumide Kolawole’s Learning Goal

**Master Clear Documentation:**
Build and maintain README files, in-code doc strings, and project wikis that
anyone (technical or not) can follow—so future you (and collaborators)
never get lost.

**Sharpen Coding Craft:**

- Write clean, modular Python scripts and jupyter notebooks
- Break tasks into well-named functions
- Follow consistent style (docstrings, naming, formatting)
- Automate simple workflows (data loading, cleaning)

**Deepen Data-Science Fundamentals:**

- Spend time each week on one concept:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques
- Basic statistics (mean, variance, confidence intervals)
- Data visualization best practices

**Lead with Empathy:**

- Take turns running agenda-driven mini-meetings or retrospectives:
- Set clear goals and timeboxes
- Invite quieter voices to share
- Capture action items and follow up

**Communicate Insights:**

- Practice translating “tech talk” into plain English:
- Write one‐pager summaries of any analysis you do
- Draft short slide decks or one-minute pitches for non-technical audiences

**Build Feedback Loops:**

- Proactively request and give feedback on both code and documentation:
- Aim for at least one constructive code review comment per teammate each week
- Iterate on your own work based on their suggestions
