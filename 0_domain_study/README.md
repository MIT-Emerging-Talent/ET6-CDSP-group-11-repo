## Investigating the Wage Gap Between Immigrants and Native Workers

## Milestone 1: Domain Research and Problem Identification

Here ia a current progress and framing work completed during **Milestone 1**,
which focuses on domain research, initial scoping, and defining the core
research problem. Our group is exploring early wage trajectories of immigrants
compared to native-born workers, with an emphasis on identifying both
personal and structural barriers that contribute to wage inequality.

---

## Group Research Overview

Our project explores the economic integration of immigrants in their first five
years in the labor market, with a focus on wage trajectories compared to
native-born workers of similar age, gender, and experience. Although we are
still refining our final research question, the shared direction among all
group members points toward understanding how both personal and structural
factors shape wage growth for recent immigrants.

We are drawing from diverse backgrounds and research interests across U.S.
and Canadian labor markets, with emphasis on sectors like tech, healthcare,
and regulated professions.

This inquiry sits at the intersection of labor economics, immigration policy,
and wage equity, with relevance for policymakers, employers, advocacy groups,
 and immigrant communities.

## Our (Evolving) Research Focus

The current guiding research question is:

**How and why do wage trajectories of employed immigrants diverge from those of
comparable native-born workers during their critical first five years, and to
what extent are these differences driven by modifiable human capital factors
versus entrenched structural barriers within the labor market?**

Group members are also exploring variants of this question based on geography,
sector, and access to data:

- **How do wage trajectories of recent immigrant software engineers differ
from native-born peers in the U.S. tech industry, and what role do credentials,
networks, and hiring practices play?**
- **How does wage growth in the first five years after arrival compare between
recent immigrants and native-born workers in Canada, accounting for gender,
occupation, and education level?**

We plan to converge toward a shared, scoped research question by Milestone 2.

## Why This Matters

Immigrants often face an initial earnings disadvantage due to language
barriers, unrecognized credentials, lack of local experience, and systemic
bias. While many experience wage growth over time, these gains are uneven.
Our project aims to unpack the wage gap patterns and the intersection of
personal skill sets and structural labor market barriers.

This research can inform:

- Policy interventions around credential recognition and wage transparency
- Targeted supports like mentorship or language programs
- Employer best practices for hiring and promotion

## Current Progress on Milestone 1

We have made substantial headway on the required deliverables for Milestone 1:

### ✅ Research & Framing Work

- Individual domain research write-ups complete
- Exploration of variables: visa status, credential type, industry, gender
- Key constraints identified: data availability, definition of “comparable”
experience, tracking wage growth over time

### ✅ In Progress

- Finalizing unified research question
- Contributor guidelines and collaboration documents being edited and merged
- Retrospective underway for Milestone 1

---

## Next Steps

- Confirm shared scope and narrow the research focus
- Align on 1–2 datasets for cross-country or cross-sector analysis
- Assign subgroups for thematic focus (e.g., credential bias, wage trends by gender)
- Continue refining collaboration workflows and contribution tracking
