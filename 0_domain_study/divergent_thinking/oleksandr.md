## Domain 1: Employment and incomes in IT

### Research questions Domain 1

 1. Impact of COVID (2020-2021) on incomes in IT in different geographic areas
 in the USA.  
(Problem, hypothesis: Remote work should reduce the difference in incomes in
the same industry over different regions)

 2. Correlation between unemployment/layoff rates in IT and development of
 artificial intelligence in the USA.  
(Problem, hypothesis: Development of artificial intelligence should increase
unemployment/layoffs in entry level vacancies but have no impact on high-level
vacancies)

### Possible constraints 1

 1. The lack of data because we the is a short period of time.  
 2. There is an impact of other factors (economic cycles) rather than COVID or
 artificial intelligence that can outside the dataset/analysis and
 significantly increase the area for analysis.

## Domain 2: Government subsidies

### Research questions Domain 2

 1. Impact of COVID (2020-2021) government subsidies on growth of GDP in G7
 countries.  
(Problem, hypothesis: Positive, negative or no effect)

### Possible constraints 2

 1. The impact of other economic trends could become more significant than
 government expenditures during 2020-2021.

## Domain 3: Economic crises

### Research questions Domain 3

 1. Impact/correlation between government expenditures in the several years
 before the crisis and the size/duration of economic crises in G7 countries.  
(Problem, hypothesis: Government expenditures postpone the economic crisis but
make it deeper and longer)

 2. Find a correlation between some economic factors and consequent economic
 crises.  
(Problem, hypothesis: there can be some economic indicators (property price,
inflation rate, unemployment level) that behaved in the same way before the
economic crisis started)

 3. Predict the next economic crisis in the USA.  
(Problem, hypothesis: the rapid growth of government debt can be an indicator
of coming economic crisis)

### Possible constraints 3

 1. During the last decades there should be enough data, but when trying to
analyze economic crises in previous decades (for example, crises in the 30’s)
there can be a lack of data.

## Domain 4: Prediction of industries or markets

### Research questions Domain 4

 1. Find a correlation between investments/the history of the development of
 “.com” in the 00s and the artificial intelligence industry in the 20-s. Try
 to predict the further development of the artificial intelligence industry.  
(Problem, hypothesis: there is a hypothesis that the rapid development of the
AI industry is very similar to the rapid development of “.com” in the 00s. If
the development curve of the AI industry repeats the “.com”, there will be a
lot of bankruptcies of currently successful AI projects)

### Possible constraints 4

 1. There should be a lot of data and researches for “.com” in the 00s, but
 there can be insufficient data for AI industry nowadays. Most of these
 projects are developed by big corporations that should restrict sharing of the
 commercial information.  
 2. Companies in “.com” and AI industries are incomparable. In “.com” industry
 there were a lot of small companies there one site www… was the main business
 of the company. In AI industry projects are developed by very big corporations
 that generate cash flows from other businesses and can support loss making
 projects for years.
