## Domain 1: Employment and incomes in IT.

### Research questions:  

 1. Impact of COVID (2020-2021) on incomes in IT by different geographic areas in the USA.  
(Problem, hypothesis: Remote work should reduce the difference in incomes in the same industry over different regions)

 2. Unemployment/layoff rates in IT related to the development of artificial intelligence in the USA.  
(Problem, hypothesis: Development of artificial intelligence should increase unemployment/layoff in entry level vacancies but have no impact on high-level vacancies)

### Possible constraints 1

 1. The lack of data because we the is a short period of time.

 2. There is an impact of other factors (economic cycles) rather than COVID or artificial intelligence that can outside the dataset/analysis and significantly increase the area for analysis.

## Domain 2: Government subsidies.

### Research questions:  

 1. Impact of COVID (2020-2021) government subsidies on grows of GDP in G7 countries.  
(Problem, hypothesis: Positive, negative or no effect)

### Possible constraints 2

 1. Impact of other economic trends and government expenditures during (2020-2021) is only small part of the global trend.

## Domain 3: Economic crises.

### Research questions:  

 1. Impact/correlation between Government expenditures in several years before the crisis and the size/duration of economic crises in G7 countries.  
(Problem, hypothesis: Government expenditures postpone the economic crises but make the deeper and longer)

 2. Try to find correlation between some factors and consequent economic crises.  
(Problem, hypothesis: there can be some economic indicators (property price, inflation rate, unemployment level) that behave in the same way before the economic crisis start)

 3. Try to find correlation between some factors and consequent economic crises.  
(Problem, hypothesis: the rapid grows of government debt can be an indicator of coming economic crisis)

### Possible constraints 3

 1. During the last decades there should be enough data but when trying to analyze economic crises in previous decades (for example crises in 30â€™s) there can be a lack of data.
