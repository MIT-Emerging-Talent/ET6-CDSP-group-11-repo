## Domain 1: Migration & Labor Economics

### Research questions

 1. What role does credential recognition play in wage suppression
among newly arrived immigrants?

 2. Do immigrants who access language or job training programs earn more
 in the first five years than those who don’t?

 3. How does prior education or work experience from the home country
 influence wage levels in the first five years?

 4. What are the average wage trends for immigrants in their first five years
 after arrival compared to native-born workers of the same age/gender?

### Possible constraints

 1. Data Constraints: availability of longitudinal data, access restrictions,
 missing data

 2. Contextual Constraints: country-specific systems, time sensitivity,
 cultural and language differences

 3. Analytical Constraints: confounding variables, causal inference limitations,
 data bias

## Domain 2: Family Management

### Research questions

 1. How does screen time in children vary with parental
 employment status or time availability?

 2. How does parental workload relate to children’s extracurricular participation?

 3. Are structured family routines associated with lower reported stress in parents?

 4. Are parents with irregular work hours more likely to report difficulty
 managing family responsibilities?

 5. Is access to affordable childcare associated with increased work hours
 for single parents?

### Possible constraints

 1. Data availability

 2. Privacy sensitivity

 3. Defining metrics

 4. Correlation vs. causation

## Domain 3: Outdoor Sports

### Research questions

 1. Is there a relationship between participation in online forums
 and progression in the sport?

 2. How does group training affect session length or frequency?

 3. How does seasonality affect outdoor sports activity levels in Northern hemisphere?

 4. What times of day and why are most popular for different outdoor sports activities?

 5. How has the use of fitness apps changed how people engage with outdoor sports?

 6. Are app users more consistent in outdoor activity compared to non-users?

### Possible constraints

 1. Data from tracking apps

 2. Weather + location-based data can be inconsistent

 3. Defining metrics
