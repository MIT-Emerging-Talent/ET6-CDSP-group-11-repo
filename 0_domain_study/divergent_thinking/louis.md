by university students to those started by professionals
with 5+ years of experience, and evaluate their effects on employment,
 digital infrastructure, and small business ecosystem

differently in Haiti, Côte d’Ivoire, and the Dominican Republic?

- Focuses on Caribbean and Francophone West Africa
- Compares countries and student performance levels
- Aims to understand how educational achievement shapes job access across regions

## Education

How does teacher absenteeism in public secondary schools affect youth employment
 outcomes in Haiti, Benin, and Guyana?

- Examines education quality (teacher presence) vs. labor results
- Explores long-term costs of poor school quality on youth futures

## Health

Which investment has a greater impact on improving youth health outcomes
in Sub-Saharan Africa: building more hospitals or improving agricultural
 infrastructure for healthier food production?”

- Designed to inform policy prioritization between health services and food systems
- Focuses specifically on youth — a high-priority population
- Compares two major development strategies
- Tied directly to health impact, not just economics

This study will compare the impact of two public investment strategies,

on youth health outcomes in selected Sub-Saharan African countries.
It will focus on key indicators such as malnutrition rates,
incidence of preventable diseases among individuals aged 15–24, and youth life expectancy.
