## 2. Domain

**Labor Economics, Immigration Policy, Wage Equity**  
This topic falls under the broader domain of labor economics, with specific
relevance to immigration policy, social integration, and wage disparities.
It intersects with public policy, demographic studies, and economic
mobility—especially within immigrant populations in high-income
countries like the U.S.

## 3. My Suggested Refactored Version (Optional)

[Rewrite the original question to make it more focused, actionable,
or realistic based on what you learned.]

**Example:**  
How do average starting wages and five-year wage growth differ for
first-generation immigrants and native-born workers in the U.S. tech
 industry between 2015–2020?
