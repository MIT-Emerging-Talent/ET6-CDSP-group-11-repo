# Bridging the Divide: Investigating the Wage Gap Between Immigrants and Native Workers

Immigrants stepping into a new country’s labor market often face an uphill
battle.

Studies show that in their first year, they can earn up to 40% less than comparable
native born workers.

A gap exists that is rooted in language barriers, unrecognized foreign qualifications,
gender, a lack of local work experience, and discrimination.

However, this disadvantage is not always permanent.

Many immigrants experience rapid wage growth in years two through five,
driven by skill adaptation, local credential recognition, and occupational
mobility.

While these gains are promising they are not evenly distributed. For some, wage
growth starts early. For others, it never catches up.

However, this early momentum frequently slows down, revealing deeper, systemic obstacles.

These structural barriers mean that despite initial progress, many immigrants never
truly “catch up” to their native peers.

The interplay between individual human capital factors (education, language
proficiency, etc.) and broader structural constraints (policy and legal framework,
labor market  e.t.c) shapes these complex wage trajectories.

Moreover, wage growth is rarely linear; it can stall or regress, especially for
vulnerable groups.

This research space is complicated by data challenges like tracking immigrant arrival
dates precisely, accounting for diverse backgrounds, and separating effects from
other demographic influences.

Unlocking a clearer understanding of these early wage patterns is critical.

It allows policymakers and community organizations to target interventions like
tailored language programs, credential recognition reforms, and policies aimed at
dismantling labor market barriers.

Our goal is to dissect these early wage journeys to not only compare immigrant and
native wage growth but also to pinpoint which factors, personal skills or structural
hurdles, most significantly influence success.

This knowledge will inform practical strategies that can make a real difference in
immigrant economic empowerment.

## Research Question

How and why do wage trajectories of employed immigrants diverge from those of
comparable native-born workers during their critical first five years, and to what
extent are these differences driven by modifiable human capital factors versus
entrenched structural barriers within the labor market?
